===        Spring PetClinic sample application - Database Configuration      ===
================================================================================

In its default configuration, Petclinic uses an in-memory database (HSQLDB) which
gets populated at startup with data. 
Note that whenever the database type is changed, the jdbc.properties file needs to
be updated.
